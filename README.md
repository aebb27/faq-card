## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### Continued development

Completing this challenge makes me realizes that I need to learn more about positioning images. Also, I have to look further at how to make font sizes responsive.
Additionally, read more documentation about CSS Naming Conventions to organized CSS Classes and achieving reusable styles through the interface.


### Useful resources

- [freeCodeCamp Build 15 JavaScript Projects](https://youtu.be/3PHXvlpOkf4?t=6511) - This helped me to understand how to close a previous question when the next one is open. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
